#  Spam Mail Detection Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting spam emails using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). It classifies messages as **spam** or **ham (not spam)** based on their content. The model is deployed with a Streamlit-based user interface and a FastAPI backend, allowing users to input email text and receive real-time predictions.
